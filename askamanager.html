					<h1>I want to ban energy drinks at my office</h1>
					<p class="byline">by ALISON GREEN on SEPTEMBER 9, 2014</p>

				<article>

					<p>A reader writes:</p>
					<p class="quotation">I am a newly appointed manager of a small community music company in the UK. We work with vulnerable young people and adults and we employ a number of young creative apprentices.</p>
					<p class="quotation">I am particularly concerned about the creative apprentices’ consumption of energy drinks. I have a background in youth work and have witnessed the negative affect misuse of energy drinks can have on young people.</p>
					<p class="quotation">Energy drinks can not be consumed by people under the age of 16. We work with young people under the age of 16. I believe if the young people we work with see our employees drinking energy drinks, we are then actively promoting the daily use of energy drinks to them. I believe I have a justified argument to ban the consumption of energy drinks at our workplace because of the people we work with and the example we need to set. What are your thoughts? Are there any legal obligations I need to be aware of when implementing this type of ban?</p>
					<p>I can’t speak to UK law, but here in the U.S., that would be legal to do. And it’s not crazy to say that because you work with vulnerable young people, you’re trying to model healthy habits (or at least not model unhealthy ones).</p>
					<p>That said, as a next step, rather than instituting an outright ban, why not talk with your staff about the issue and get their input? They probably have insights worth considering, and if nothing else, if you do decide to move ahead with a ban, people are likely to feel better about it if they know that they had a chance to give input first. (That means that it should be a genuine conversation though — you have to really be open to hearing their opinions.)</p>
